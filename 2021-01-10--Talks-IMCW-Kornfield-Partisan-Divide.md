Intro
- to heal partisan divide and bring peace, we need to first bring peace to our own hearts

- dalai lama "global emotional hygiene" - start inside first

- navigating conflict: visualize hand of a great being, bring calm, on other hand visualize holding hand of a compassionat being. Brings a different approach to handling conflict. 
  - conflict is not new 
  - Buddha and Jesus both had conflicts with family and community

- Buddhism - First noble truth - Dukkha - woven into life is a challenge
  - praise/blame, gain/loss, fame/disrepute, ...

Quotes
> "line dividing good and evil cuts through every human being" - cannot just isolate the evil otherwise we cut off a part of ourselves

> "aim of politics is to keep populous alarmed - hob goblins most of which are imaginery" - mankin (sp?)

> "the reason we cling to hate stubbornly is that once hate is gone we will need to deal with our own pain" - James Baldwin

> "enemy is best friend, it teaches us what matters to us and who we are" - dalai lama

How do we do work towards healing?
  - pause and breathe (e.g. Ghandi took silent day weekly while deconstructing British overule)
  - Align with a trust - turning of seasons, generational rebirth, there is a cycle to trust in
    - moral arc of universe turns toward justice
  - willingly turn heart toward the circumstances
    - turn toward difficulty - "be medicine for sick, food for hungry, lamp for those in darkness..."
    - "others will be cruel, we shall not be cruel, others will speak falsely, we shall speak truth..." -Majjhima Nikaya 
    - "take care of those deserving, and those who are not" - Tao Te Ching
  - deep listening and inquiry
    - not to "call out", but to "call in" with curiosity
    - what makes you angry? what are you afriad of? what's best outcome for us all? 
    - listen without changing, people do not want to be changed, bare witness to perspective with loving heart
  - stay with what you know is true as a "zone of peace"
      - "this is what matters to me..." - people treated with dignity, people are heard, etc.
      - despair is not needed, we need hope and possibility to heal
      - in face of urgent issues, do not add to polarization
        - realize it took a long time to come to breaking point, it may take time to move forward with patience
