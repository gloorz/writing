## Current Approach
**During Day**
- Consistent sleep/wake time (+/- 1 hour) everyday
  - Try to see outside lightrays from rising sun (not through sun glasses or UV tinted glass)  
- Eliminate caffiene - green tea or other minimally caffinated before noon (caffiene 6 hour half-life)
- Eat minmally, clean food (WFPB) and bulk of food mid-day (no heavy meals right before bed) - stop eating 4 hours prior to bed
- Finish bulk of hydration 4 hours before bed
- Finish bulk of work or exciting tasks/chores 4 hours before bed
- Exercise and physical activity during day, everyday
- Manage cumulative stress and take time to recuperate from stressful situations

**One Hour before bed**
- low light / minimal screens 
- Tea (minimal quantity to minimize getting up to go to bathroom)
  - [valerian root tea](https://celebrationherbals.com/valerian-root.html) / [chamomile]( https://celebrationherbals.com/chamomile-flowers.html)
- Magnesium citrate - 1 pill 
- Comedy tv show (30 minutes) 
- [Light Qi-Gong (5-10 minutes)](https://vimeo.com/165652965)
- Yoga Tune-up  
  - Coregeous Ball on abdomen 
- To explore:
  - cold shower
  - meditation 

## Reading Notes
- [Huberman Lab - Podcast](https://hubermanlab.com/sleep-toolkit-tools-for-optimizing-sleep-and-sleep-wake-timing/)
  - Temperature
    - Need to drop temps before bed
      - Cold shower? 
    - Need to raise temps when waking up 
      - Light exercise?
  - Light - try to get it close to sun-up directly - not through car windsheild, etc. 
    -  5 minutes sunny morning, 20-30 if overcast rain
    -  Triggers natural morning cortisol boost and sets clock for going to bed

- Light and dark
- Temperature
- Food what, when, amount
- Exercise raise temp and alertness

- Adenosine accumulates to create sleep  - caffeine blocks this process


Supplements:
- Magnesium threonate - can cause g/i distress
- Theanine - can create intense dreams that are anxiety inducing
- Apigenin (chamomile is natural source, likely lower dose than supplement)
- Taken an hour before bed

Digital tools:
- Non-sleep deep rest scripts
- Yoga nidra
- Revelli app (has cost)


Perfect 24 hours;
- Temperature increases to awaken
- Increase cortisol (in a good way)
- View bright sunlight 30 to 60 minutes after waking
  - Triggers cortisol release
  - This effectively sets the timer for falling asleep later in the day on time
  - Need to get low solar angle (morning)
  - No sunglasses and not through window (prescription glasses okay)
  - Light viewing does the foundational power tool for ensuring a great night's sleep
  - If waking up before sunrise, turn on artificial lights in the house
    - It's not a replacement, but it's better than nothing
  - There is an asymmetry, where we need to prevent light into the eyes in the evening
  - on cloudy days, you especially need to get outside to accumulate light to the eyes. Amount is highly dependent on where one lives and their own sensitivity to light.
  - Clear day - 5 min, cloud - 10 min, dense over caste - 20-30 min
  - Do this for 80% of the days of your life, if sick try to get near a window, if traveling try to get more duration the next day
  - Use phone based light meter to get a sense of light intensity


Temperature

- Increase temperature more rapidly
  - Cold shower (has inverse effect on body temp) 1-3 min
  - Exercise/movement/walk will raise body temp (either 30 min, 3 hours, or 11 hour after waking)
    - walk, skip rope outside in sunlight 
    - doesn't need to be full workout for day


Caffeine
- Delay caffeine for 90- 120 minutes - this avoids afternoon crash
do other practices first


Food timing
- Eating earlier in day increases temp and metabolism
- Be careful of food volume as this one inherently create sluggishness


Three critical periods 
- morning - critical periods 1 (1-4 hours after waking)
- throughout day - critical period 2 - watch caffeine and careful naps
  - body temp peaks mid day
  - Don't nap so late or so long that are disruptibility to sleep at night
  - use nsdr, yoga nidra, etc. As alternative to naps
  - light mid day - get some late day sunset low solar angle light in the eyes to inoculate against light disruptions that may incur from artificial light later in the evening
- critical period 3 - evening - hours before sleep 
  -  avoid all bright artificial light of any color
  -  much more sensitive to light later in the evening
  -  artificial light from overhead is the worst, due to sensors in the eyes. Using low lights that body level is a better option.
  -  10pm to 4am keep it as dark as safely possible 
  -  decrease body temp - hot shower creates compensatory cooling off
  -  create a cool and cold sleeping environment

Consistency - wake time, even on weekends
