## Intro - Run Hot (even when cold)

A recent run at 0 degrees F (-20 F wind chill) was a nice reminder that it's quite manageable to embrace cold weather if done with a little planning. Winter days are also really beautiful and consistent days outside largely eliminate any sense of "cabin fever". 

These ideas are mostly focused around relatively continuous running, walking, or hiking where the body tends to stay warm and there isn't much standing around. 

Activities that are more start/stop like cold outdoor work or downhill skiing (and riding chairlift) where multiple minutes are spent not moving can create downtime where it's much easier to get cold. The general approach to layering is the similar, but I do find that it's much easier to get really cold with start/stop activities. 

## Planning and Be Responsible

Cold exposure can become dangerous quickly (minutes). The coldest weather of the year is typically a time when I hang to local lower risk trails/paths, keep things short, have bail out plan, and let people know where I am going (always a good idea). This is multi-purpose. If I get hurt or stuck I want to be able to get safe quickly without issue. Equally important is avoiding the risk of calling on first responders or rescue teams and exposing them to a situation that could have been avoided. 

## Layer Up!

**Base layer** - this layer is to get the moisture away from the body and maintain heat. There are different "weights" of base layers from long johns, to fleece lined tights (in ladies and men's fit). 

**Mid Layer** - This is insulator - keep the body warm and basically create a nice fuzzy barrier. Should also be something that wicks moisture (e.g. fleece, recycled wool, etc.)

**Outer Layer** - This layer seals it all up and blocks out cold cutting wind, etc. Even if no wind, cold temps can seem to slice right through all the layers. A good outer layer will have sturdy wind/weather block while also being breathable. Especially for running or hiking type activities, a rubber rain jacket that holds in all the nicely wicked moisture would not be ideal. 

### Other notes

**Minimize exposed skin or draft areas** - tuck in shirts, layer at overlapping spots, etc. Cold weather will bite right through these exposed areas. 

**WARM HEAD** - Keeping all of head (forehead, ears, part of neck, etc.) warm is really key. Lots of temp management here. Sometimes I will double up hats as long as they fit well together. 

**WARM CORE** - I really try to make sure my torso is well protected and stays warm. When my chest and back get cold the whole situation tends to get unconformable pretty quick. This involves decent mid-layers, vests, etc. 

**WARM NECK** - similar to WARM CORE, if I feel a lot of cold on the back of my neck it's really a bummer and makes me feel cold quickly. This is usually a combination of neck gaiter, collar, and hood. 

**Maintain Circulation** - layers shouldn't be so tight as to restrict blood flow. It's the warm blood flowing that keeps things warm. 

**Try to Stay Dry** - I find a bit of sweat manageable if I keep moving and get warm and dry quickly after. If things get wet otherwise (like outdoor work or falling in water) it's critical to get dry quickly (or prevent getting wet in first place if possible). 

**"Cotton Kills"** - a quote from some old country folks. I think the idea is that cotton holds moisture from sweat and has cooling effect (which is opposite of staying warm...).

**Vegan Minded** - If you feel the need to wear animal-based products then recycled or second hand items are likely a decent route. 

**Experiment** - Plan to do little experiments in different conditions in a safe way (around town, etc.), every body is different enough to warrant slightly different approaches. 

## Accumulate Quality Gear

Purchasing higher quality gear can often be the most frugal and performant choice. Quality gear can seem really costly, but if taken care of it can last for decades and tends to positively reinforce getting outside in the cold because it actually feels good. This can be acquired over time and/or grabbed via second hand avenues (or end of season sales). The key with quality gear is that it usually performs really well, is lightweight so mobility is maintained even with layers, and it tends to last (and/or have solid manufacture repair/replace programs). I would prioritize core and extremities. 

## Breathing Hard

If running or vigorous hiking, breathing cold air can be really abrasive on the respiratory machinery. Two points here:

1. I find if I start cold weather activity early in the fall and ease into breathing cold air it allows time to acclimate given our gradual shift from fall to winter in Northeast.
1. Slow down and mostly breath warmer air through a fleece mask. If it gets too hot I will briefly pull down mask to get some air and then pull back. Otherwise, I largely try to avoid heavily breathing really cold air as it feels really rough on throat and lungs after.

## Misc

Try to be warm in the house. If it's cold inside it might seem mentally unbearable to subject oneself to colder temps. In the winter I will wear winter hats, base layers, and excessive blankets in the house in an effort to always feel warm in our drafty old house.
