## Nature Verses
- All the megapixels in the world can't capture the beauty like open eyes
- The blood orange sunset radiates effortlessly like the open heart
- Loons dining in the hazy sunset with fragrant summer smells 
- The barrage of thoughts like the pummelling of 10,000 rain drops extinguishes the soul until we let go of needing to be dry
- Instant hot water does not mean instant hot tea
- On a precarious windy snowy night the trees collectively blow in unison like dizzying ocean swells
- Early leaves shyly drop in a salute to the changing season
- the world continues to spin without us sprinting
- The fall foliage like cinnamon drops steadily as we rush by
- One-time floss sticks, q-tips, and bottle caps collect like dandruff on the curb side


## Misc
- I am no soliquist
- When I read poems I barely get the gist
- My eye for creativity died on the STEM
- Walks in the world some words spring up
- It's not clear why they are there
- Or whether or not I should care
- It gives resonance and meaning
- To trails and sidewalks this time has well worn
- The wisdom of age becomes rung like a wood drum
- With layers of time and exploration
- Trial and error
- Trial and air

- grabbing scoops of water from the stream 
- trying to capture and hoard all of life
- it's really hard to hold on to all of it at once
- get your arms around it they say
- the systems seems to infinitely expand
- our arms are only so long
- is decomposition and breakdown critical in the process?
- what for arms to do if not for getting around things?
- maybe going with the flow of the stream is an option
- maybe capturing nothing is the path
- maybe it's time to give our arms a rest

Like a tumbleweed dropping into the stream of dharma
Comes up like a glass house
Breaks into 10,000 unitelligble pieces
User manual 2600 years old
Motivation to reaaseemble dubious
Enviosiong a new house and a new shelter
Envisioning the stream as the lesson and the vessle
Taking on a new shape and size
Molting, breaking and burning
Emerging as a flower
The flower opens and closes with the weather
While arising and passing with the changing seasons
