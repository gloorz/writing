- The blood orange sunset radiates effortlessly like the open heart
- Loons dining in the hazy sunset with fragrant summer smells 
- The barrage of thoughts like the pummelling of 10,000 rain drops extinguishes the soul until we let go of needing to be dry
- Instant hot water does not mean instant hot tea
- On a precarious windy snowy night the trees collectively blew in unison like ocean swells
- Early leaves shyly drop in a salute to the changing season
