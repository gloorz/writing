_Stream of concious writing_

# Nature Verses
- All the megapixels in the world can't capture the beauty like open eyes
- The blood orange sunset radiates effortlessly like the open heart
- Loons dining in the hazy sunset with fragrant summer smells 
- The barrage of thoughts like the pummelling of 10,000 rain drops extinguishes the soul until we let go of needing to be dry
- Instant hot water does not mean instant hot tea
- On a precarious windy snowy night the trees collectively blow in unison like dizzying ocean swells
- Early leaves shyly drop in a salute to the changing season
- the world continues to spin without us sprinting
- The fall foliage like cinnamon drops steadily as we rush by
- One-time floss sticks, q-tips, and bottle caps collect like dandruff on the curb side


## Misc
- I am no soliquist
- When I read poems I barely get the gist
- My eye for creativity died on the STEM
- Walks in the world some words spring up
- It's not clear why they are there
- Or whether or not I should care
- It gives resonance and meaning
- To trails and sidewalks this time has well worn
- The wisdom of age becomes rung like a wood drum
- With layers of time and exploration
- Trial and error
- Trial and air

- grabbing scoops of water from the stream 
- trying to capture and hoard all of life
- it's really hard to hold on to all of it at once
- get your arms around it they say
- the systems seems to infinitely expand
- our arms are only so long
- is decomposition and breakdown critical in the process?
- what for arms to do if not for getting around things?
- maybe going with the flow of the stream is an option
- maybe capturing nothing is the path
- maybe it's time to give our arms a rest

- Like a tumbleweed dropping into the stream of dharma
- Comes up like a glass house
- Breaks into 10,000 unitelligble pieces
- User manual 2600 years old
- Motivation to reaaseemble dubious
- Enviosiong a new house and a new shelter
- Envisioning the stream as the lesson and the vessle
- Taking on a new shape and size
- Molting, breaking and burning
- Emerging as a flower
- The flower opens and closes with the weather
- While arising and passing with the changing seasons

- If we are lucky the waste will be fed to the animals
- We got the hot air balloon
- Did it really need to be made any better?
- Who really needs to travel that far from home?
- Usually the people that need to flee are least likely to get a ride
- While whitey is on the moon
- Galavanting and polar expressing are the rest
- While the dinner goers go hungry with discontent
- Send the fish back, it's not cooked right
- The garabage stacked with good calories
- And across town people go hungry

- The record player emits sweet rythm and blues
- While the fine china cabinet crashes to the floor
- Pieces smashing everywhere
- With barefeet you know you will need to walk
- Through it all to clean it up
- To make sense of it all you will get cut
- There is likely not enough glue to put it all back together
- It will likely be necessary to consider a new China cabinet
- And new China
- Or maybe nothing will take the place
- We will find out in time what will fill that old space

- The table has been set in a new way that is beyond recognition
- Somehow it's the same room
- Someehow it's the same guests
- But everything seems different
- "Nothings changes" they would all say
- Before the question had even left their mouth
- But everthing is different 
- It's all so significantly different
- It feels like a new hermit crab in the old shell
- A new drink in an old vessel
- A new fresh air in an old 

- Even when tired, time with good friends leaves us with energy
- Even when uninspired, time with good friends brings inspiration
- We are social beasts with fangs and claws
- The act is simple, put away the fangs and claws
- No matter our differences, Be nice to each other
  - I thank him for holding the door for me
- No matter our differing directions, take care of each other
  - "yeah baba" he says as we pass each other
- Be an inspiration in how we carry ourselves
- Abundance creates the ability to give
- Giving was never about the reciever
- Giving dissolves our sense of ownership
- It all starts and ends with generosity to all


- sometimes I stare at the sun for too long
- it's fun to lick 9-volt batteries
- playing with fire has always been pretty cool
- What do these things say about a person
- is it necessary to do this?
- where do I go from here?
- sometimes people drive fast
- sometimes people yell and fly off the handle
- is it necessary to do all this?
- 9 volt batteries taste weird, don't do that

- It was a full beaver moon
- until it was totally eclipsed
- then it turned into a blood red moon
- Many things are uncertain
- but the full moon and the eclipse were not one of them
- it's election day too
- that _is_ uncertain
- how we will be in this world is exceedingly uncertain
- but the moon will continue to be eclipsed
- the earth will continued to spin
- and the sun will continue to shine

## COVID Dreams - April 2020
Couldn't sleep the other night, thoughts were looping, here they are:

When it's all over will we have dreams about it
When it's all over will we question our time worrying about nukes instead of it
When it's all over will there be pictures on big screens about it
When it's all over will we believe life comes in cycles and is about more than it

When it's all over will we be stronger for it
When it's all over will be tell our grand kids about it
When it's all over will our grand kids not give a damn about it
When it's all over will our grand kids make the same mistakes about it

When it's all over will we remember that people are what let us reconnect about it
When it's all over will we remember how confident we were about the world before it
When it's all over will we remembered how much we missed our family about it
When it's all over will we remember that all the money in the world couldn't do shit about it

When it's all over will we remember the precious life lost about it 
When it's all over will we remember there is still a life to live and not about it
When it's all over will we remember to hug about it
When it's all over will we remember to love about it

Maybe we can learn what truly matters throughout it
Maybe we can learn to love throughout it
Maybe we can learn how short life is throughout it
Maybe we can learn how much I miss you throughout out
