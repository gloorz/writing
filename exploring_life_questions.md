# Growth/Exploration 
- As intention, how do we want to ***show up*** when engaging with our teams and organizations? What characteristics do we want to bring?

- What practices are we engaging in the process, what practices/trades/skills do we want to hone, what enables us to do that?
> "The good life is a process, not a state of being. It is a direction, not a destination." - Bruce Lee[ 1]

- Where are we tense and where are we flexible?
> "Do not be tense, but be ready; not thinking, but not dreaming; not being set, but flexible. It is being wholly and queitly alive, aware, and alert; ready for whatever may come..." - Bruce Lee [1]
